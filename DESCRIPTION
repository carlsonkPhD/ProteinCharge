Description: This package calculates the charge of a protein given as either a string or a supplied as a text file and creates a plot of the charge over a range of pH values from 0-14. This information can be used to identify the isoelectric point of the protein and can aid in the design of ion exchange (IEX) chromatography purification strategies.
